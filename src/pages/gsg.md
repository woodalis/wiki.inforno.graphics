## Other games
In [**grand strategy games**][gsg], players control *states*,
to build up their economy, wage war and dominate the world.
These games often abstract away things like internal party opposition, the autonomy of businesses and other sources of "irrationality" so that the player can direct all the resources of their state and focus on grand strategy, on conflicts with other states.
Being able to micromanage which economic policies are in use, what factories produce and where troops are deployed are all part of the fun of the genre.

Players often get detailed information about the people living in their state, who are a valuable resource to be managed.
For example, the game [Victoria 2][vicky2] is focused on managing a state's economy from the Industrial Revolutions into the Great War.
Making sure that factories get a steady supply of labour is vital to keeping the economy growing,
so the game gives the player [information on every "pop"][vicky2 pop tab], where a "pop" represents a household.
This includes up-to-date data on their political leanings, how likely they are to revolt and whether their resource needs are met.
Using this information, the player can adjust taxes, give or take away rights and suppress revolutionaries to keep labour in check.

Governments in that time period did not have access to the depth of information given by these games.
Censuses existed so population estimates weren't an issue;
however, knowing the people's hopes, desires and identities wasn't possible back then.
Mass surveillance makes this possible for today's states.

## Historical context
In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked various documents which confirmed the existence of global mass surveillance programs ran by the NSA and allied agencies across the world.
This came as a shock to the general public, though the existence of these programs had long been suspected.
Many of the new powers that were given to intelligence agencies came after the 9/11 attacks, in the name of counter-terrorism.
However, it is important to remember that mass surveillance through less sophisticated means (e.g. ECHELON) has existed and much infrastructure long predates the "War on Terror".

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the stagnation of Japan's economy has left America as the sole hegemon.
Russia, despite Putin's efforts, is no longer anything more than a "regional power", as Obama said.[^1]
Only recently has China risen to challenge America.
