In computer [**grand strategy games**][gsg], players are often given information about the population of their state.
For example, Victoria 2 gives the player [information on every "pop"][vicky2 pop tab],
which represents a household, including their political leanings and whether their resource needs are met.

Recently many governments can access to the level of information that these games give;
mass surveillance makes this possible.
