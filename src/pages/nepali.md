My family talks and has alwayed talked to me in **Nepali**, but I can't speak Nepali back to them.
They all understand English so responding hasn't ever been an issue.
Even so, I want to learn Nepali.
Some reasons why include:
 * I want to get closer to other Nepali people.
 * I want to speak the [Limbu language][limbu] and Nepali language resources may be useful.
 * The political situation in Nepal is interesting and I want to learn more about it.
