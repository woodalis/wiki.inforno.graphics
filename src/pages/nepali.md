I've been spoken to in **Nepali** by my family for most of my life.
Still, I don't know much Nepali;
I can listen to short sentences but I can't speak, read or write Nepali or listen to longer sentences.
I've decided to teach myself Nepali for a few reasons:
 * I want to read Nepali opinions on Nepali politics.
 * I want to learn the [Limbu language][limbu] and being able to read Nepali language resources may help.
 * It's the lingua franca of Nepal and used by the Nepali diaspora.
